1. Create a second server on AWS or Virtual Machine in Virtual Box. This one will host core node.
2. Create the directory .local/bin and add it to the PATH 
3. Use `scp` to copy `cardano-node` and `cardano-cli` binaries to this new server. 
4. Alternatively follow  [Installing and running a node ](../getting-started/install-node.md)again to build the node from source in your new server or Virtual Machine.
