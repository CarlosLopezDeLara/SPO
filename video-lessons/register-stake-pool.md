# Register stake pool and metadata

In this lesson you will learn how to register you stake pool and its metadata to the blockchain. Among other things this will allow your pool to be discovered by other pools \(and add you to their topology\) and integrate your pool with Daedalus and Yoroi wallets so that potential delegators can easily delegate their stake to you.
