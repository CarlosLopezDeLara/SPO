# Using the faucet

### Requesting funds to the faucet

The faucet is a web-based service that provides test ada \(also known as 'tADA', 'fake ada' or 'fADA'\) to users of the testnet. While these tokens have no 'real world' value, they enable users to experiment with Cardano testnet features, without having to spend real ada on the mainnet.
